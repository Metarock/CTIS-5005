    <h2 class="myH2">Azmeel's Ethical Reflection</h2>
    <p class="myR">

    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        I believe that artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics is ever-evolving in our society, with it looking to
        play a massive role in our daily lives in the future. It will play a big part in making things easier for
        humans, as the technological sector will only continue to improve and refine the many software’s and hardware it
        creates, especially in the health sector’s surgical field. AI robotics in surgical health can provide many
        opportunities and choices for surgeries to improve through autonomous surgical machines. Currently, any form of
        robotics relies on the manual capabilities of a surgeon. However, this can all be changed by introducing AI
        robotics, allowing for better and safer surgical techniques without any human error. An example of this could be
        in aid of suturing, as the number of mistakes that AI can cause is less than that of a human and during the
        suturing process. The amount of tissue that is removed by the machine is significantly smaller than the
        traditional surgical method; meaning that the recovery time is shorter and that the scaring left behind is
        reduced substantially (Shademan et al., 2016). Through this, I can see that AI can make things easier not on.ly
        for the surgeon who can reduce their operation times by half simply by relying on this procedure but also the
        patients who are being operated on by the machine can be assured that it won’t get tired or lack precision
        during the surgery. Therefore, increasing the chances of the operation being successful. The choices that AI in
        robotics can provide to the populous is by allowing surgical machines that are currently operated using humans
        could be converted to a complete autonomous surgical machine by implementing AI. An example is the Davinci
        machine, which has four arms, each fitted with a surgical instrument to help carry our surgical procedures (Ngu
        et al, 2017). Implementing an AI into the system of machines would allow surgeons to step back and all the
        machines to complete the surgery while they observe the procedure. The choices AI can give us are boundless,
        primarily how it can be implemented in the existing machines that we have now. Another option AI provides to the
        patient is choosing whether they wish to be operated on by either a human or a machine, allowing them to have
        freedom of choice and comfort when they are wheeled into the operating room. I believe it is imperative that the
        patient get to choose how they wish to get their operation done so that the patient can feel comfortable when
        going through the procedure instead of feeling anxious.
    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        However, just as there are positive aspects present in AI robotics so are negatives, with the risks, especially
        regarding ethical breaches that can occur from either the hospital providing the procedure or the manufacturers
        who create it. Doing my share of research for the topic allowed me to see just how many implications can occur,
        especially when it comes to the software in technology which is not always full proof when implemented. I can
        explain this by looking at the ACM Code 2018 Task Force (2018), which explains how a professional should push to
        create high-quality work and avoid software malfunctions or incorrect predictions. This especially holds true
        during surgery; because such a scenario could cause catastrophic results, such as during mid-operation. An
        example of this is the self-driving car created by Google, which crashed into the side of a bus due to an
        incorrect prediction made by the AI program (Harris, 2016). This point only emphasises that AI programs will
        never be full proof, meaning that surgical centres and hospitals will need to consider things like this if they
        wish to adopt the autonomous procedure as it will come with its risks. Another ethical issue is whether the AI
        program is robust enough to stand against external threats, such as malware and cyber-attacks that may target
        hospitals. An example of this has occurred in New Zealand’s Waikato Hospital, which had all its systems shut
        down due to a ransomware attack (Leahy, 2021). If such an attack were to occur while the robot was in surgery or
        was being set up for one, could pose a severe safety risk due to the harm it can bring to the patient. This may
        only prove that manufacturers of the robotic system need to make the AI's security system a primary concern due
        to the increased cyber-attacks on medical facilities by making sure to continuously test and patch
        vulnerabilities in their systems. Hence, their software is always up to date.
    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        Lastly, I see that the greed of monetary gain poses the most considerable ethical risk. Meaning that
        manufacturers who try to push their product into the market without rigorously testing their system may cause
        harm by not explaining any limitations or potential problems that may rise from their software. This was
        emphasised through the US healthcare algorithm which favoured white patients needing extra medical care over
        black patients, with black patients having varied healthcare costs compared to white patients who suffered from
        the same conditions. This racism continued into the justice system, where an algorithm called COMPAS had access
        to the US court database, which predicted the likelihood of those who would be a repeating offender. The system
        predicted 43% for black offenders and 23% for white ones (Shin, 2020). If such an AI system was to be
        implemented further into the healthcare system without proper testing and trailing could pose significant moral
        and ethical risks to the patient that are under the machine. This would only build upon the bias that already
        exists in our society by favouring specific groups for better care compared to others, therefore breaking the
        moral code of a healthcare worker which build on the trust, integrity, respect and honesty they must show to the
        patient.
    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        Overall, I believe that the implementation of AI will be a massive game-changer in the healthcare field.
        However, as the ethical challenges are ever-present would mean that manufacturers should make sure their systems
        are robust enough and give fair treatment to all patients. Furthermore, suppose healthcare centres choose to
        adopt their AI. In that case, they should make sure it will follow the same professional and moral codes a human
        would, as the surgeon will always have an obligation to care for their patient, so should the machine adopted to
        take their place.
