    <h2 class="myH2">John's Ethical Reflection</h2>
    <p class="myR">
        The world is rapidly developing especially for robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, heavily
        invested in the 20th century on the use of robots on various fields in the healthcare industry. This exciting
        technology brings potential and may change the way we work in the healthcare. One of the advantages is that it
        gives healthcare easier and faster for people to access (Ministry of Health, 2019), the ability to offer new
        technology and services to
        patients allowing automation of physical tasks, in this case AI surgical robots, so that workforce can focus
        more on a patient’s wellbeing. Thus, increasing the accuracy of service delivery and remove a subsequential
        amount of human error, improving the overall productivity of the healthcare workflow.
    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        However, implementation of AI to surgical robots also comes with ethical challenges as the healthcare industry
        would need to consider their stakeholders(Ministry of Health). Yes, AI integrated with surgical robot may
        improve the overall
        productivity of the health system, increase value in service delivery. However, one of the questions I ponder as
        I was doing this project is safety along with privacy, and I believe it is one of the biggest challenges that
        the AI faces in the workforce. An example of this is IBM Watson for Oncology which basically uses an AI to train
        and assess patient’s information medical records and assist physicians to explore cancer treatment options
        (Gerke et al, 2020). But
        this backed fired, as the AI’s recommendation were deemed to be unsafe and incorrect for cancer treatments, due
        to the AI being trained to a few “case studies” rather than real patient’s data. This potentially brings
        inconsistency and may need a revision of regulation and procurement of devices & services
