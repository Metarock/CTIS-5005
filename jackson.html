    <h2 class="myH2">Jackson's Ethical Reflection</h2>
    <p class="myR">
        Ethical issues in relation to the effects of artificial intelligence using robotics in surgical health care are
        mainly seen
        to be the ever increasing autonomy of robotics and the developments of artificial intelligence which may in the
        future be
        able to guide these robotics through a complete surgical procedure. Thus ethical issues are going to arise on
        where the
        line in the sand is going to be drawn as to how much control over choices the AI will have when operating within
        a surgery.
        As there are certain rules conducting how robotics must interact with humanity such as not harming humans. Rules
        like this
        which the AI must follow may come into jeopardy when the robot must create incisions onto a person and begin
        surgery on
        them, also it may be difficult if unforeseen circumstances arise during surgery and the robot may be required to
        make a
        difficult decision between levels of pain for the human there may be a white line on how the robot should make
        that
        decision or if it even should be making the decision. My personal reflection is that in the near future, before
        AI and
        robotics have the ability to conduct a complete surgery autonomously, there must be new laws and legislations
        regarding
        these blurry ethical boundaries to ensure that the robotics installed are creating the most benefit possible for
        society.
        With little to no areas where the law may be exploited or unclear.
    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        From the research which I have conducted, I recommend that through surgical robotics, there is never complete
        autonomy for the
        robotic AI to complete a whole surgery by itself. I believe that the robot should always be controlled by a
        human who makes
        the important decisions for the robot, while the robotics and AI may be made to adapt to different surgeons and
        how they
        operate rather than to conduct a surgery by themselves. This way, there will always be a person who is liable
        for the
        decisions made while conducting surgery on another human being. While the robotics will continue to just aid and
        make the
        surgeons life easier rather than replacing many peoples job which they have spent countless hours studying for.
