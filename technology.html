    <h2 class="myH2">Robotics Surgery in the age of pandemics</h2>
    <h3 class="myH3">
        At the age of COVID-19 where it has caused us to distant from each other, it is a threat to surgeons. Surgical
        surgery is one of the main foundation of any healthcare system with both elective and emergency
        operations contributing to the health services of the population (Zemmar et al, 2020). Operatin rooms are
        potentially high-risks
        areas for transmission due to the involvement of multiple teams, and high-risk activties.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="myH3">
        To effectively reduce the spread, AI robotic surgery can be integrated at several sections of the sequence,
        which
        each surgical patient traverses during a hospital stay (Randell et al, 2020). Allowing for the workflow to be
        divided into
        pre-operative care, anaesthesia, the surgical procedure and postoperative care, the overall goal of this is to
        minimize contact between patient and healthcare provider at each step.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="myH3">
        AI Robotic surgery has its benefits and risks, depending on the stakeholders. For example, nn terms of New
        Zealand
        patients/public it will mean easier and faster Healthcare services for people to access and can be in places
        healthcare workfadce can't such as rural setting (Ministry of Health, 2019). However, access to this technology
        may not yet be publicly
        funded, out of private finanical reach for some individuals. Additionally, robots aren't always the answer, it
        has to be useful to the patient. Thus why we chose AI on Surgical Robots as our team's topic
