        Although AI in surgical health can be beneficial there are also many risk factors that can be involved first and foremost is the ai  as it is a piece of software and can never be completely full proof as there are many factors that can cause problems to arise as stated by Puaschunder (2019) as Data corruption can occur during robotic surgical procedures causing the robot to either cease functioning mid operation causing either medical complication such as affecting the patientsâ€™ health or even causing permanent damage this can lead to repercussion felt for hospital, which can then risk some form of lawsuit. Errors can also occur in the initial programming of the machine as this will not be found by the doctor who lack knowledge in the specific field, which can in turn lead to an inevitable issue during surgery which can yet again prove fatal to the Patient who is being operated on. There are also the issue of data sets in ai as scenarios where 

There are data breaches and external intrusions that can occur as not software systems are full proof therefore it can allow hacker to control the medical robot during pre or post-surgery, as ai systems cannot operate independently from the network an example of this is the cyber-attack that occurred in both US and New Zealand Hospitals as the attackers breached the hospital computers causing them to be shut down and surgeries being postponed with medical staff unable to access patient notes and information, If an ai robotic system were present at this time would only create another avenue for hackers to get a hold of you medical records and files through the ai in the robotic system 

The gradual decrease and reliance that we begin to have on robotic surgeons may can cause surgeons to be completely replaced in the future by the robotic procedures, leading to a decline of surgeons in specific surgical fields.

There are also many Ethical risks as described by Spillman and Sade (2014) who explain this by breaking it down, as argument can be made that that robotic surgery can hurt patients, as manufacturer will need their robot to adhere to the same ethical principal as the surgeon, as a lack of said principals could put the patient at risk of harm. 
Another point highlighted is how malfunctions regarding the robotic machinery will cause the patient to suffer in the end, as they cannot see if there are any problems with the ai system, meaning they put their full trust in the robot operating on them. Lasty, they discuss how more potential harm can occur if both manufacturer and hospital are aiming to promote robotic machinery without regarding potential harm the robotic system may cause, because just as a surgeon have a duty to their patient, so does a manufacturer to their stakeholders. This can risk in surgeons or hospital staff having their opinions ignored or overalled by those holding a higher position or a representative from the industry, this in turn can place the patient at risk for monetary gain. This can also be seen if a surgical centre or surgeon try to endorse were to endorse the robotic procedure without any sort of objective data can be considered misleading, deceptive and unethical, as this indorsement can effect patient safety and wellbeing.
